# Nuxt I18n Micro

`Nuxt I18n Micro` is a fast, simple, and lightweight internationalization (i18n) module for Nuxt. Despite its compact size, it's designed with large projects in mind, offering significant performance improvements over traditional i18n solutions like `nuxt-i18n`. The module was built from the ground up to be highly efficient, focusing on minimizing build times, reducing server load, and shrinking bundle sizes.

## Why Nuxt I18n Micro?

The `Nuxt I18n Micro` module was created to address critical performance issues found in the original `nuxt-i18n` module, particularly in high-traffic environments and projects with large translation files. Key issues with `nuxt-i18n` include:

- **High Memory Consumption**: Consumes significant memory during both build and runtime, leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Slow Performance**: Especially with large translation files, it causes noticeable slowdowns in build times and server response.
- **Large Bundle Size**: Generates a large bundle, negatively impacting application performance.
- **Memory Leaks and Bugs**: Known for memory leaks and unpredictable behavior under heavy load.

### Performance Comparison

To showcase the efficiency of `Nuxt I18n Micro`, we conducted tests under identical conditions. Both modules were tested with a 10MB translation file on the same hardware. We also include a **plain-nuxt** baseline (no i18n module) to measure the real overhead.

#### Build Time and Resource Consumption

> **Note:** The `plain-nuxt` baseline is a minimal implementation created solely for benchmarking purposes. It loads data directly from JSON files without any i18n logic. Real-world applications will have more complexity and higher resource usage.

| Project | Build Time | Max Memory | Max CPU |
|---------|------------|------------|---------|
| **plain-nuxt** (baseline) | 4.48s | 609.55 MB | 242.60% |
| **i18n-micro** | 7.88s | 1164.02 MB | 336.00% |
| **i18n v10** | 77.81s | 9494.69 MB | 449.00% |

- **i18n-micro vs baseline**: +3.40s build, +554.47 MB memory
- **i18n v10 vs baseline**: +73.33s build, +8885.14 MB memory

#### Stress Test Results (Requests per Second)

| Project | Avg Response | RPS | Max Memory |
|---------|--------------|-----|------------|
| **plain-nuxt** | 106.50 ms | 318.00 | 229.02 MB |
| **i18n-micro** | 516.70 ms | 225.00 | 366.69 MB |
| **i18n v10** | 1130.20 ms | 51.00 | 1050.38 MB |

#### Comparison: i18n v10 vs i18n-micro

- **Max Memory Used**: -683.69 MB (i18n-micro uses less)
- **Average Response Time**: -613.50 ms (i18n-micro is faster)
- **Requests Per Second**: +174.00 (i18n-micro handles more)

These results clearly demonstrate that `Nuxt I18n Micro` significantly outperforms the original module in every critical area while staying close to the plain Nuxt baseline.

## Key Features

- 🌐 **Compact Yet Powerful**: Despite its small size, `Nuxt I18n Micro` is designed for large-scale projects, focusing on performance and efficiency.
- ⚡ **Optimized Build and Runtime**: Reduces build times, memory usage, and server load, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
- 🛠 **Minimalist Design**: The module is structured around just 5 components (1 module and 4 plugins), making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
- 📏 **Efficient Routing**: Generates only 2 routes regardless of the number of locales, thanks to dynamic regex-based routing, unlike other i18n modules that generate separate routes for each locale.
- 🗂 **Streamlined Translation Loading**: Only JSON files are supported, with translations split between a global file for common texts (e.g., menus) and page-specific files, which are auto-generated in the `dev` mode if not present.

## Quick Setup

Install the module in your Nuxt application with:

```bash
npm install nuxt-i18n-micro
```

Then, add it to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'nuxt-i18n-micro',
  ],
  i18n: {
    locales: [
      { code: 'en', iso: 'en-US', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'fr', iso: 'fr-FR', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'ar', iso: 'ar-SA', dir: 'rtl' },
    ],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    translationDir: 'locales',
    meta: true,
  },
})
```

That's it! You're now ready to use Nuxt I18n Micro in your Nuxt app.
