# Nuxt I18n Micro

`Nuxt I18n Micro` is a fast, simple, and lightweight internationalization (i18n) module for Nuxt. Despite its compact size, it's designed with large projects in mind, offering significant performance improvements over traditional i18n solutions like `nuxt-i18n`. The module was built from the ground up to be highly efficient, focusing on minimizing build times, reducing server load, and shrinking bundle sizes.

## Why Nuxt I18n Micro?

The `Nuxt I18n Micro` module was created to address critical performance issues found in the original `nuxt-i18n` module, particularly in high-traffic environments and projects with large translation files. Key issues with `nuxt-i18n` include:

- **High Memory Consumption**: Consumes significant memory during both build and runtime, leading to performance bottlenecks.
- **Slow Performance**: Especially with large translation files, it causes noticeable slowdowns in build times and server response.
- **Large Bundle Size**: Generates a large bundle, negatively impacting application performance.
- **Memory Leaks and Bugs**: Known for memory leaks and unpredictable behavior under heavy load.

### Performance Comparison

To showcase the efficiency of `Nuxt I18n Micro`, we conducted tests under identical conditions. Both modules were tested with a 10MB translation file on the same hardware.

#### Build Time and Resource Consumption

**Nuxt I18n v9**:
- **Total size (build)**: 13.7 MB (2.2 MB gzip)
- **Max CPU Usage**: 248.50%
- **Max Memory Usage**: 3057.23 MB
- **Elapsed Time**: 0h 0m 12s

**Nuxt I18n Micro**:
- **Total size (build)**: 229 KB (152 KB gzip) ‚Äî **13.47 MB or 98.36% smaller (2.05 MB or 93.10% smaller gzip)**
- **Max CPU Usage**: 195.00% ‚Äî **21.53% lower**
- **Max Memory Usage**: 1140.63 MB ‚Äî **-1916.6 MB less memory**
- **Elapsed Time**: 0h 0m 7s ‚Äî **-5 seconds faster**


#### Server Performance (10k Requests)


**Nuxt I18n v9**:
- **Requests per second**: 34 [#/sec] (mean)
- **Time per request**: 1487.60 ms (mean)
- **Max Memory Usage**: 9958.67 MB

**Nuxt I18n Micro**:
- **Requests per second**: 339 [#/sec] (mean) ‚Äî **305 more requests per second (897.06% increase)**
- **Time per request**: 5.10 ms (mean) ‚Äî **-1482.50 ms faster (99.66% reduction)**
- **Max Memory Usage**: 405.20 MB ‚Äî **-9553.47 MB less memory usage (95.93% reduction)**

These results clearly demonstrate that `Nuxt I18n Micro` significantly outperforms the original module in every critical area.

## Key Features

- üåê **Compact Yet Powerful**: Despite its small size, `Nuxt I18n Micro` is designed for large-scale projects, focusing on performance and efficiency.
- ‚ö° **Optimized Build and Runtime**: Reduces build times, memory usage, and server load, making it ideal for high-traffic applications.
- üõ† **Minimalist Design**: The module is structured around just 5 components (1 module and 4 plugins), making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
- üìè **Efficient Routing**: Generates only 2 routes regardless of the number of locales, thanks to dynamic regex-based routing, unlike other i18n modules that generate separate routes for each locale.
- üóÇ **Streamlined Translation Loading**: Only JSON files are supported, with translations split between a global file for common texts (e.g., menus) and page-specific files, which are auto-generated in the `dev` mode if not present.

## Quick Setup

Install the module in your Nuxt application with:

```bash
npm install nuxt-i18n-micro
```

Then, add it to your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'nuxt-i18n-micro',
  ],
  i18n: {
    locales: [
      { code: 'en', iso: 'en-US', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'fr', iso: 'fr-FR', dir: 'ltr' },
      { code: 'ar', iso: 'ar-SA', dir: 'rtl' },
    ],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
    translationDir: 'locales',
    meta: true,
  },
})
```

That's it! You're now ready to use Nuxt I18n Micro in your Nuxt app.
