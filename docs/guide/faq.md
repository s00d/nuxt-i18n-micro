# ‚ùì FAQ: Common Issues & Solutions

Find answers to frequently asked questions and solutions to common problems with Nuxt I18n Micro.

## üöÄ Getting Started Issues

### ‚ùì What if a route doesn't load?

When using `Nuxt I18n Micro`, certain routes might not load as expected, especially if the router doesn't automatically assign a name to a route in subfolders.

**Solution:**
To address this, manually define the route name for the page by adding the following to the corresponding Vue file:

```javascript
definePageMeta({ name: 'pageName' })
```

This ensures the route is properly registered, enabling seamless navigation within the application.

### ‚ùì Why does `$t` or other i18n composables not work in Nuxt plugins?

Nuxt I18n composables (`$t`, `$getLocale`, `$localePath`, etc.) may not work as expected within Nuxt plugins or utility functions, resulting in runtime errors.

**Cause and Solution:**
Nuxt composables require specific contexts (e.g., Nuxt hooks or Vue setup functions) to access the Nuxt instance. If used outside of these contexts (e.g., in utility functions or plugins), the following error might appear in the console:

```
[nuxt] A composable that requires access to the Nuxt instance was called outside of a plugin, Nuxt hook, Nuxt middleware, or Vue setup function. This is probably not a Nuxt bug. Find out more at https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports#vue-and-nuxt-composables
```

**Solution 1: Use `runWithContext`**
To call i18n composables after an asynchronous operation, use [`runWithContext`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-nuxt-app#runwithcontext) to preserve the necessary context.

```javascript
await nuxtApp.runWithContext(() => $t('test_key'))
```

**Solution 2: Retrieve Value First**
Alternatively, retrieve the translation value first, then pass it to a utility function.

```javascript
const val = nuxtApp.$t('common.errors.unknown.title')
showError({
    title: val
})
```

**Solution 3: Pass Translation Keys in Services**
In services or utility functions, pass the translation keys instead of using `$t` directly. Then, fetch the translation in the component.

```javascript
showError({
  title: 'common.errors.unknown.title',
  message: 'common.errors.unknown.message',
  i18n: true
})
```

## üåê Translation Issues

### ‚ùì Why do translations break during page transitions, especially with `defineAsyncComponent`?

When using `nuxt-i18n-micro` with page transitions, translations may briefly stop working during the transition. This issue occurs because the route changes before the transition completes, causing translations for the new page to load while the old page is still visible.

**Root Cause:**
- Page transitions cause route changes before translations are fully loaded
- `defineAsyncComponent` and `useAsyncData` can delay translation loading
- Translation keys may appear as raw paths during loading

**Solution 1: Enable Experimental Fallback (Recommended)**

Use the experimental `i18nPreviousPageFallback` feature to automatically fall back to previous page translations during transitions:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  i18n: {
    experimental: {
      i18nPreviousPageFallback: true
    }
  }
})
```

**How it works:**
- Saves previous page translation information during navigation
- Uses previous page translations as fallback when current page translations are not available
- Cleans up previous page translations only after the new page is fully loaded

**Solution 2: Explicit Route Context**

If you prefer manual control, explicitly pass the current route to `$_t`:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
  import { useNuxtApp } from '#imports'
  const route = useRoute()
  const { $_t } = useNuxtApp()

  const $t = $_t(route)
</script>

<template>
  {{ $t('page::blog-slug.title') }}
</template>
```

**Solution 3: Loading States**

Implement loading states to handle translation loading gracefully:

```vue
<template>
  <div v-if="pending">
    <div class="loading-skeleton">
      <!-- Loading placeholder -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    {{ $t('page.title') }}
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const { data, pending } = await useAsyncData('page-data', () => {
  // Your async data loading
})
</script>
```

### ‚ùì Why are translation keys not resolving during SSR on Vercel?

**`$fetch` limitations on SSR**
On serverless platforms like Vercel, `$fetch` can only fetch static files from the CDN and not from the internal Nitro server. This means static translation files may not be directly accessible unless the correct base URL is set.

**Fix by setting `apiBaseUrl`**
If translations are hosted externally, specify the full URL (e.g., `https://example.com/_locales`) for `$fetch` to access the translations correctly during SSR.

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  i18n: {
    apiBaseUrl: 'https://example.com/_locales'
  }
})
```

## üîó Routing & Navigation Issues

### ‚ùì Can I use `NuxtLink` or `i18nLink` directly in translation strings?

Yes, `Nuxt I18n Micro` allows the use of `NuxtLink` or `i18nLink` within translations through the `<i18n-t>` component, which is especially helpful for handling grammar and RTL language requirements without splitting translation strings.

**Example:**

Translation file:
```json
{
  "example": "Share your {link} with friends",
  "link_text": "translation link"
}
```

Vue template:
```vue
<template>
  <i18n-t keypath="example">
    <template #link>
      <nuxt-link :to="{ name: 'referral' }">
        <i18n-t keypath="link_text" />
      </nuxt-link>
    </template>
  </i18n-t>
</template>
```

This allows dynamic links within translations while preserving proper localization structure.

## üèóÔ∏è Build & Deployment Issues

### ‚ùì Why is the `assets/_locales/` folder added to the server folder?

During deployment, especially on platforms like Netlify, the build process might differ from local development. This can lead to issues where certain files or folders are missing during server-side rendering (SSR).

**Explanation:**
- **Build Process:** Translation files are cached in the production folder during the build. However, on Netlify, server code moves to functions, sometimes isolating localization files.
- **Prerendering:** Prerendering does not work with `$fetch` in SSR, causing middleware to miss localization files.
- **Server Assets:** To resolve this, localization files are saved in the Nitro server assets during prerendering. They are then accessible in production directly from server assets.

### ‚ùì Why do I get a build error referring to `@unhead/vue` or an undefined object, especially on Cloudflare Pages?

**Cause:**
Some projects experience build conflicts or missing dependencies when using `nuxt-i18n-micro`. In particular:
- Deployments on **Cloudflare Pages** or **Cloudflare Workers** may require additional compatibility flags.
- Prerendering steps can fail if dependencies like `@unhead/vue` are not properly installed.
- Certain modules (e.g., **nuxthub**, **nitro-cloudflare-dev**) can introduce conflicts unless configured with correct flags or dependencies.

**Possible Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Install `@unhead/vue` manually**
If the build error complains about not finding `@unhead/vue`, install it directly in your project's dependencies:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @unhead/vue
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @unhead/vue
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @unhead/vue
```

:::

This ensures it's available during the Nitro prerender phase.

**Solution 2: Add Cloudflare compatibility flags**
When using Cloudflare Pages or Cloudflare Workers, Node.js compatibility is often disabled by default. Enable it in your `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat_v2" ]
```

This flag allows many Node.js modules (including those used by `nuxt-i18n-micro`) to run smoothly.

## üîß Configuration & Compatibility

### ‚ùì Is `Nuxt I18n Micro` inspired by `vue-i18n`? What about modifiers?

While `Nuxt I18n Micro` serves as a performance alternative to `nuxt-i18n`, it's built independently of `vue-i18n`. While some method names and parameters may be similar, the underlying functionality differs significantly.

**Modifiers**: The maintainer initially considered modifiers, but concluded that components like `<i18n-t>` and `<i18n-link>` effectively address those needs.

For example:

```vue
<template>
  <i18n-t keypath="feedback.text">
    <template #link>
      <nuxt-link :to="{ name: 'index' }">
        <i18n-t keypath="feedback.link" />
      </nuxt-link>
    </template>
  </i18n-t>
</template>
```

This approach is flexible, so releasing modifiers is currently unnecessary. However, modifiers may be added in future releases if there is demand.
