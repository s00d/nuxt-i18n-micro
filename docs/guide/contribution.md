# 🤝 Contribution Guide

## 📖 Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `Nuxt I18n Micro`! We welcome contributions from the community, whether it's bug fixes, new features, or improvements to the documentation. This guide outlines the steps to help you get started and ensures that your contributions can be easily integrated into the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. 📚 Familiarize Yourself with the Project

Before making changes, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the project's architecture and codebase. Read through the existing documentation and take a look at open issues and pull requests to understand ongoing work and challenges.

### 2. 🍴 Fork the Repository

- Navigate to the [Nuxt I18n Micro repository](https://github.com/s00d/nuxt-i18n-micro).
- Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 3. 📥 Clone Your Fork

Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nuxt-i18n-micro.git
cd nuxt-i18n-micro
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

### 4. 🌱 Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names, such as `bugfix/fix-translation-error` or `feature/add-new-locale-support`.

# 🛠️ Local Development Setup

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v16 or later
- **npm**: v7 or later
- **pnpm**: v9 or later

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. 📥 Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the `nuxt-i18n-micro` repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s00d/nuxt-i18n-micro.git
cd nuxt-i18n-micro
```

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies using pnpm.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter "./packages/**" run build
pnpm run prepack && cd playground && pnpm run prepare && cd ..
```

### 3. 🖥️ Run the Development Server

To start the development server and work on the module, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command will start the Nuxt development server using the `playground` directory as the testing environment. You can view the app in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. 🏗️ Building the Module

To build the module, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run prepack
```

This command prepares the module by building the necessary files, stubbing certain components, and ensuring everything is ready for packaging.

### 5. 🧹 Linting the Code

To ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards, run the linter:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

If there are any issues, you can attempt to automatically fix them using:

```bash
pnpm run lint:fix
```

### 6. ✅ Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run test:workspaces
pnpm run test
```

This will run all the Playwright tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

### 7. 🔍 Type Checking

For TypeScript type checking, run:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test:types
pnpm run test
```

This checks the type definitions to ensure there are no type errors.

### 8. 📚 Building and Previewing the Documentation

To build and preview the documentation locally, use the following commands:

```bash
pnpm run docs:build
pnpm run docs:serve
```

This will build the documentation and serve it locally, allowing you to view it in your browser.

### 9. 🎮 Running the Playground

If you want to test your changes in a sample Nuxt application, the `playground` directory serves as a sandbox environment. Run the following command to start the playground:

```bash
pnpm run dev:build
```

You can access the playground app at `http://localhost:3000`.
